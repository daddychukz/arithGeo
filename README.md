# arithGeo
A function that checks if an Array argument is Arithmetic, Geometric, neither Arithmetic nor Geometric, or if the array is Empty

An arithmetic progression is one whose difference between each item remains constant.

To find if an array is arithmetic, subtract an element from the element before it through the array. if the result is constant, then its arithmetic.

A geometric progression is one whose value remains constant when you divide an item with the previous.

To find if an array is geometric, divide an element from the element before it through the array. if result is constant, 
then its geometric.
